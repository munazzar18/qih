                  QIH was envisaged by a group of Pakistani doctors who had
                  extensive training and highest qualification from USA. & UK.
                  The aim is to establish an institution which is patient and
                  physicians friendly, provides excellent quality health care to
                  all in a very professional and compassionate way under one
                  roof at a very affordable price and to provide free medical
                  services to deserving patients as much as possible.
                </p>
                <p className="entry-desc">
                  This group of physicians is already providing free medical
                  services to many and are actively involved in other social and
                  community welfare services from the platform of Q.I.H,
                  millions of rupees have been spent on earthquake hit areas by
                  supplying food, clothes, and medicines etc. Over 300 women and
                  children have been looked after for more than a year at the
                  site of Q.I.H by establishing an earthquake relief camp
                  including a school for earthquake affected children. Q.I.H is
                  still providing shelter to many children studying in the best
                  English medium schools of Islamabad.

                  Numerous other welfare activities including free Hepatitis B
                  vaccination programs for general public including Islamabad
                  traffic police, financial assistance to schools for special
                  children and blind, free tube well for water supply to local
                  population are some of the other examples.

                  Millions of dollars have been spent on the project without
                  borrowing. The plan is to keep the project interest free. As
                  we all know a lot of finances are needed for a project of this
                  magnitude. We have come up with the Unique Concept of
                  Partnership by offering some of the hospital rooms to the
                  public and corporate sector, which will give both an
                  opportunity to high yield investment and a positive
                  contribution to health care sector, which is the most
                  neglected area in our country. In addition we are also
                  offering shares in General Partnership.

                <p className="entry-desc">
                  The success of this idea will change the health care system of
                  our country and many volunteers and investors will come
                  forward and start building excellent heath care facilities
                  with this concept which otherwise seems very difficult as
                  hospitals need huge capital to begin with. The success of this
                  concept is evident from numerous successful housing and
                  apartment schemes in our country.

                <p className="entry-desc">
                  The hospital will attract talent especially highly qualified
                  physicians from abroad to come back to their home country and
                  serve. It will not only provide employment to over 2000 people
                  but will bring millions of dollars as foreign exchange to the
                  country.

                <p className="entry-desc">
                  The plan of a hotel along with the hospital will be very
                  convenient for patientâ€™s families to stay and could be open
                  for general public due to its location on GT. Road close to
                  motorways and Islamabad International airport.

                  In the end I would like to thank all those who helped us in
                  this project in any form and to thank those in advance who
                  will join us in this noble cause.
