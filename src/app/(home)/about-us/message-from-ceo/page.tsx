            QIH was envisaged by a group of Pakistani doctors who had extensive training and the highest qualifications from the USA and UK. The aim is to establish an institution that is patient- and physician-friendly, providing excellent quality health care to all in a very professional and compassionate way under one roof at a very affordable price and to provide free medical services to deserving patients as much as possible.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted">
            This group of physicians is already providing free medical services to many and is actively involved in other social and community welfare services from the platform of QIH. Millions of rupees have been spent on earthquake-hit areas by supplying food, clothes, and medicines. Over 300 women and children have been looked after for more than a year at the site of QIH by establishing an earthquake relief camp, including a school for earthquake-affected children. QIH is still providing shelter to many children studying in the best English medium schools of Islamabad.

          <p className="text-muted">
            Numerous other welfare activities, including free Hepatitis B vaccination programs for the general public (including Islamabad traffic police), financial assistance to schools for special children and the blind, and free tube wells for water supply to the local population, are some examples.

            Millions of dollars have been spent on the project without borrowing. The plan is to keep the project interest-free. As we all know, a lot of finances are needed for a project of this magnitude. We have come up with the unique concept of partnership by offering some of the hospital rooms to the public and corporate sector. This provides an opportunity for high-yield investment and a positive contribution to the healthcare sector, which is the most neglected area in our country. Additionally, we are also offering shares in General Partnership.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted">
            The success of this idea will change the healthcare system of our country, and many volunteers and investors will come forward to start building excellent healthcare facilities with this concept. Hospitals require huge capital to begin with, but the success of this concept is evident from numerous successful housing and apartment schemes in our country.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted">
            The hospital will attract talent, especially highly qualified physicians from abroad, to come back to their home country and serve. It will not only provide employment to over 2,000 people but will bring millions of dollars as foreign exchange to the country.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted">
            The plan of a hotel along with the hospital will be very convenient for patients' families to stay and could be open for the general public due to its location on GT Road, close to motorways and Islamabad International Airport.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted">
            In the end, I would like to thank all those who helped us in this project in any form and to thank those in advance who will join us in this noble cause.
